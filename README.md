# TeachAdmin

## Project Mission

To provide tools for teachers to manage their teaching content for and the works of their students, this includes everything from scores to actual reviews w/ or w/o comments on said students' work.
The goal is to utilize Python and some well-known frameworks (Django, matplotlib, seaborn, Elasticsearch, LangChain ... more may be needed) to accomplish this.
I have personally created a whole backend involving chatbot logic with OpenAI's GPT models and Anthropic's Claude models, so I am confident that I should be able to go a long way when it comes to letting LLMs generate content for teachers. However, since education is such a critical service we provide as a society, we can't afford to just take these auto-generated contents for granted, thus I am prepared to do everything it takes to make this process as reliable as possible.

If this project does eventually become something significant, it may become a part of a larger system that I have already thought about creating. As this is the very first part of that larger idea, I would like to see it grow first before I dive straight into the next project.

## Code Architecture

The idea is to utilize Django to create the Frontend+Backend connection for the project, then use the NumPy, matplotlib and seaborn frameworks to compute and visualize the teachers' data. Finally, the idea is also to manage the teachers' curriculum data with the LangChain and Elasticsearch framworks/teachnologies. As of today, April 28th 2024, I have not yet thought out the process as to HOW this should be managed, but only have a rough idea.
I constantly seek people with more expertise in these areas than myself, so if you do know a lot about any of these subjects, feel free to issue a PR or join the team by reaching out.

## History

I have been wanting to actually execute this project ever since I re-started my programming career as I do have a strong urge to contribute to society in a straight-forward way. This OpenSource project will NEVER require teachers to pay anything.

THESE TOOLS SHALL ALWAYS BE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE. PERIOD.

It doesn't matter which country you're from; teachers across the globe have to be sandwiched between stupid politics, ideologies and attitudes from kids that makes today's teaching environment outright toxic to many.
If we can easen their work, even by just a little, it will make a better future for all of us - not just the kids, but the people surrounding them too. We are all connected, and this project aims to fully realize that reality.
